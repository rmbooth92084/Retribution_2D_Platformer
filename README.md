# Retribution_2D_Platformer
 This is a retribution of my senior design project that me and my classmates made in the Spring of 2021. It is a 2D platformer that we created in Unity with custom assets that we made. The UCR class is CS179N with professor Dr.Craig Shroeder. The purpose of this was to make an origin game in a team of 5 students.
